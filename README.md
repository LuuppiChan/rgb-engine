# Info
This is a hobby project and as such I don't currently have any plans on supporting any other keyboards officially. But with a bit of tinkering it could maybe be done. But for a first time hobby project this is enough tinkering already for now.

Also this assumes my custom fn layout if you're going to use any key events. Check my config out: `045a0673980efcf95b5f5b6c959eb63b0f9f`
